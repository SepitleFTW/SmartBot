SmartBot - AI-Powered Chatbot

SmartBot is an AI-powered chatbot designed to interact with users in real-time using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning models. The project leverages advanced AI models like OpenAI GPT-3 or Hugging Face Transformers to provide intelligent and context-aware responses to user queries. The chatbot can be used in various applications, including customer support, knowledge bases, and general conversation.
